This script makes the end-effector draw a square in 3D space.
Note that this script may not work for every arm as it was designed for the wx250.
Make sure to adjust commanded joint positions and poses as necessary.

To get started, open a terminal and type:

    ros2 launch interbotix_xsarm_control xsarm_control.launch robot_model:=wx250

Then change to this directory and type:

    python3 ee_cartesian_trajectory.py
