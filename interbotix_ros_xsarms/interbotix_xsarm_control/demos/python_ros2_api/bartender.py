This script makes the end-effector perform pick, pour, and place tasks.
Note that this script may not work for every arm as it was designed for the wx250.
Make sure to adjust commanded joint positions and poses as necessary.

To get started, open a terminal and type:

    ros2 launch interbotix_xsarm_control xsarm_control.launch.py robot_model:=wx250

Then change to this directory and type:
